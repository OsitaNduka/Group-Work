 The scenario: ![alt text](BankDataBreach.png)
A bank manager approached an Amazon Web Services (AWS) product manager about a data leak that occurred 6 months ago. As a result of the leak, the bank lost money.

The bank manager has concluded that it’s time to make fundamental changes to the bank’s systems operations. The manager isn’t satisfied with the efficiency of the bank’s systems operators. 

The manager also has concerns about the security of sensitive customer information and the stability of the bank’s systems. The manager has lost confidence in the expertise of the SysOps team. This situation has driven the manager to approach AWS.

### 🔑 **Key Areas & Questions**:

#### 🔒 **Security**:
- “Can you tell us more about **how the breach happened** and the **security measures** that were in place at the time?”
- “Was **customer data** encrypted at rest and in transit?”
- “Are there any **existing AWS security tools** currently being used, such as **IAM**, **GuardDuty**, or **KMS**?”

#### ⚙️ **System Stability**:
- “How often does **system downtime** or **performance degradation** occur?”
- “Are there particular **services** or **applications** where you see the most issues?”
- “Have these **stability issues** been affecting **critical banking operations**?”

#### 🚀 **Efficiency**:
- “Are there any specific **SysOps processes** that are causing **significant delays** or **errors**?”
- “How is the current **incident response process** managed? Is there a need for **better automation** or **monitoring**?”
- “Is the **SysOps team** experiencing **challenges with AWS tools**, or is there a skills gap?”

#### 🎯 **Future Expectations**:
- “What would a **successful resolution** look like for you?”
- “Is the goal primarily to improve **security**, **stability**, or **efficiency**, or a combination of all?”
- “Would you prefer a **long-term AWS partnership**, or are you looking for a more **specific short-term solution**?”

These questions, coupled with the right AWS services, will help you align the bank’s needs with tailored solutions.

### 🎯 **Objective**: Understand the bank manager’s key concerns, clarify expectations, and gather relevant information for proposing a solution.
