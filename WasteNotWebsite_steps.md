To create an AWS-based food waste management application based on the **WasteNot** opportunity analysis, we will design the system using AWS services aligned with the requirements you've outlined. This will ensure the platform efficiently connects retailers with surplus food to individuals and charities in need while monitoring, scaling, and securing the solution as it grows.

Here's how we would architect and develop the WasteNot application using AWS:

### **AWS Application Architecture for WasteNot** üçΩÔ∏è‚ôªÔ∏è

#### **1. Frontend (Web & Mobile Application)** üåêüì±

- **Amazon CloudFront** üåç: 
  - **Purpose**: Distribute static assets (images, CSS, JavaScript) from edge locations to reduce latency for users accessing the app across the UK.
  - **Implementation**: CloudFront will cache static resources stored in S3, providing fast delivery to users. This will enhance the performance and responsiveness of both the web and mobile applications.

- **Amazon S3** üóÇÔ∏è:
  - **Purpose**: Store static files (like food images and reports) used by the frontend of the application.
  - **Implementation**: S3 will host web assets, such as images of food waste posted by retailers. All media and static content can be accessed via CloudFront.

#### **2. Backend (API and Business Logic)** üíª

- **Amazon API Gateway** üîå:
  - **Purpose**: Manage and route HTTP API requests to backend services, providing a unified interface for accessing resources.
  - **Implementation**: API Gateway will expose REST APIs for client apps (mobile/web). Users can interact with the platform for tasks like viewing available food items, uploading new food offers, and booking collections.

- **AWS Lambda** ‚öôÔ∏è:
  - **Purpose**: Serverless functions to execute the business logic without managing servers. Lambda will handle tasks like processing food item uploads, querying databases for available food, and managing session data.
  - **Implementation**: Lambda functions will execute when a user submits or retrieves food donation data, interacting with databases and other services. Lambda will scale automatically based on demand.

#### **3. Databases and Storage** üíæ

- **Amazon RDS** üóÉÔ∏è (Relational Database Service):
  - **Purpose**: Store structured data like user profiles, food item listings, donation history, and booking records.
  - **Implementation**: Use a relational database like Amazon RDS (MySQL/PostgreSQL) for transactional operations such as booking food collections and storing user data. RDS can be configured for high availability using Multi-AZ deployments.

- **Amazon DynamoDB** üóÇÔ∏è:
  - **Purpose**: Store unstructured or real-time data, like quick access metadata for food categories and real-time session management.
  - **Implementation**: DynamoDB will be used for low-latency access to data such as frequently queried records or logs of user interactions.

- **Amazon S3** üñºÔ∏è:
  - **Purpose**: Store media assets such as images of donated food or documents.
  - **Implementation**: Retailers can upload images of perishable items nearing their expiry, which will be stored in S3. This allows users to view food items available for donation.

#### **4. Authentication and User Management** üë•

- **Amazon Cognito** üîê:
  - **Purpose**: Manage user authentication, allowing retailers, charities, and individuals to sign in and access the platform securely.
  - **Implementation**: Cognito will handle user sign-up, sign-in, and access control. It can be integrated with third-party providers like Google or Facebook for social logins. Cognito also supports multi-factor authentication (MFA) for enhanced security.

#### **5. Notifications and Communication** üì¢

- **Amazon SNS** üîî (Simple Notification Service):
  - **Purpose**: Send real-time notifications to users about available food, collection reminders, and updates.
  - **Implementation**: SNS can send SMS or mobile push notifications to individuals and charities based on proximity to a retailer posting surplus food.

- **Amazon SES** ‚úâÔ∏è (Simple Email Service):
  - **Purpose**: Send email alerts, notifications, and updates to users.
  - **Implementation**: SES will be used to send emails, such as reminders for scheduled food pick-ups, or newsletters with updates on WasteNot‚Äôs impact.

#### **6. Monitoring and Logging** üìä

- **Amazon CloudWatch** üïµÔ∏è:
  - **Purpose**: Monitor and gather metrics such as API response times, Lambda function performance, and other application metrics.

By implementing this **AWS-based architecture**, WasteNot can efficiently reduce food waste and provide assistance to those in need across the UK. The platform will be scalable, secure, and resilient, leveraging the full potential of AWS's serverless and managed services.



To create the **WasteNot food waste management application** using AWS services, we'll break down the process into **step-by-step instructions**. This guide assumes you have access to the services specified in your environment, like AWS Lambda, S3, DynamoDB, API Gateway, and Athena.

### Step 1: **Set up an S3 bucket for data storage**
1. **Log in to the AWS Management Console**.
2. **Navigate to S3**.
3. Click **Create bucket**.
   - **Bucket Name**: `wastenot-food-images`
   - **Region**: Choose a region closest to your users (e.g., us-west-2).
   - **Permissions**: Block all public access (recommended for security).
4. Click **Create bucket**.

This bucket will store any images related to food waste reporting.

---

### Step 2: **Create a DynamoDB Table to Track Waste**
1. **Go to the AWS Management Console**, and navigate to **DynamoDB**.
2. Click **Create table**.
   - **Table Name**: `FoodWasteRecords`
   - **Primary Key**: `RecordID` (String)
3. Configure any secondary indexes if needed, but for now, keep the default settings.
4. Click **Create table**.

DynamoDB will store records of food waste reports, including attributes like the date, amount of waste, type, and who reported it.

---

### Step 3: **Create a Lambda Function for Waste Reporting**
1. **Navigate to AWS Lambda** in the AWS console.
2. Click **Create function**.
   - **Name**: `TrackFoodWaste`
   - **Runtime**: Choose **Python 3.x** or **Node.js** (you can use other languages based on your preference).
   - **Role**: Choose **LabRole** (or the role with permissions to access DynamoDB and S3).
3. Click **Create function**.

#### Add code to the Lambda function:
This code stores data in DynamoDB when a report is submitted.

Example **Python** code for the Lambda function:
```python
import json
import boto3
from datetime import datetime
import uuid

# Initialize DynamoDB
dynamodb = boto3.resource('dynamodb')
table = dynamodb.Table('FoodWasteRecords')

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    # Generate a unique RecordID
    record_id = str(uuid.uuid4())
    
    # Collect data from the event input (API Gateway will pass the data)
    waste_amount = event['wasteAmount']
    waste_type = event['wasteType']
    location = event['location']
    reported_by = event['reportedBy']
    
    # Insert the record into DynamoDB
    response = table.put_item(
        Item={
            'RecordID': record_id,
            'Date': str(datetime.now()),
            'WasteAmount': waste_amount,
            'WasteType': waste_type,
            'Location': location,
            'ReportedBy': reported_by
        }
    )
    
    return {
        'statusCode': 200,
        'body': json.dumps('Waste report submitted successfully!')
    }
```

4. **Deploy the function** after adding the code.

---

### Step 4: **Create an API Gateway for Lambda Integration**
1. **Go to API Gateway** in the AWS console.
2. Click **Create API** > **HTTP API**.
   - **Name**: `WasteNotAPI`
3. In the **routes** section, create a route:
   - **Method**: POST
   - **Path**: `/waste/report`
4. For the **Integration target**, choose your **TrackFoodWaste Lambda function**.

Now, you have an API that allows users to report food waste data.

---

### Step 5: **Enable S3 Pre-signed URLs for Image Uploads**
You can add another Lambda function for generating pre-signed URLs for uploading images to the S3 bucket.

1. **Create another Lambda function**:
   - **Name**: `GeneratePresignedURL`
   - **Runtime**: Choose **Python 3.x**.
   - **Role**: Choose the same **LabRole**.
   
2. Add the following code to generate pre-signed URLs:
```python
import boto3

s3_client = boto3.client('s3')
BUCKET_NAME = 'wastenot-food-images'

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    # Extract the file name from the event
    file_name = event['fileName']
    
    # Generate a pre-signed URL for uploading an image
    response = s3_client.generate_presigned_url('put_object', 
                                                Params={'Bucket': BUCKET_NAME, 'Key': file_name},
                                                ExpiresIn=3600)  # URL expires in 1 hour
    
    return {
        'statusCode': 200,
        'body': response
    }
```

3. In **API Gateway**, create a new route:
   - **Method**: GET
   - **Path**: `/generate-upload-url`
   - **Integration target**: Select the `GeneratePresignedURL` Lambda function.

Now users can request pre-signed URLs and upload images.

---

### Step 6: **Monitor Waste Trends using CloudWatch and Athena**
1. **Enable CloudWatch Logs** for your Lambda functions:
   - Go to **CloudWatch** > **Logs** and ensure logging is enabled for both `TrackFoodWaste` and `GeneratePresignedURL` Lambda functions.
   
2. **Use Athena for querying waste reports**:
   - Upload any logs or data from DynamoDB into S3 for querying using **Athena**.
   - Create a table in Athena that reads the data from S3.

Example query to analyze waste trends:
```sql
SELECT Date, Location, SUM(WasteAmount) AS TotalWaste
FROM "your-s3-data-bucket"
GROUP BY Date, Location
ORDER BY TotalWaste DESC;
```

---

### Step 7: **Set up CloudWatch Alarms for Waste Thresholds**
1. Go to **CloudWatch** > **Alarms** > **Create Alarm**.
2. Choose the Lambda metric (such as the number of food waste reports).
3. Set an alarm for when the waste reports exceed a certain number (e.g., 100 in a day).
4. Configure **Amazon SNS** to send notifications (via email or SMS) when the alarm is triggered.

---

### Step 8: **Test the Application**
1. **Test the Lambda functions** using the AWS console to ensure data is being stored correctly in DynamoDB.
2. **Test the API Gateway** using tools like Postman or curl to submit reports and retrieve pre-signed URLs.
3. **Upload images** using the pre-signed URL and check that they are stored in the S3 bucket.

---

### Step 9: **Deploy the Application**
Once everything is tested and working, you can deploy the application and make it available to end-users. You can create a simple front-end interface (using AWS Cloud9 or an external web framework) to interact with the API Gateway, allowing users to:
- Submit waste reports
- View analytics on food waste
- Upload images

---
