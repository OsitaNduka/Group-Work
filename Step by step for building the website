Step-by-Step Guide to Building a Website on AWS (with Workarounds)
Step 1: Set Up the S3 Bucket to Host Your Static Website
Go to the AWS S3 Console:

Open the AWS Management Console and search for S3.
Click on S3.
Create an S3 Bucket:

Click Create bucket.
Give your bucket a globally unique name (e.g., wastenot-website1).
Choose your AWS region.
Leave all other settings as default and click Create bucket.
Enable Static Website Hosting:

Go to your newly created bucket, and click on the Properties tab.
Scroll down to the Static website hosting section.
Click Edit and Enable static website hosting.
Set the Index document to index.html.
You can leave the Error document blank.
Click Save changes.
Upload Your Website Files:

In the Objects tab, click Upload.
Upload your index.html, booking.html, styles.css, or other frontend files.
Once uploaded, ensure they have public read access.
Make the S3 Bucket Public:

Go to the Permissions tab of the bucket.
Scroll down to the Bucket Policy section and add this policy:
json
Copy code
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::wastenot-website1/*"
        }
    ]
}
Replace wastenot-website1 with your actual bucket name.
This allows public access to your website files.
Get the S3 Static Website URL:

In the Properties tab, scroll to Static website hosting and copy the Endpoint URL.
This will be your website's public URL.
Step 2: Create the Lambda Function for Backend Logic
Go to the AWS Lambda Console:

Search for Lambda in the AWS Console and click Lambda.
Create a New Lambda Function:

Click Create function.
Choose Author from scratch.
Name the function (e.g., SubmitBookingFunction).
Choose the Runtime (e.g., Node.js 18.x).
Click Create function.
Write the Lambda Function Code:

Scroll down to the Code section of the Lambda function.
Replace the default code with this Node.js example to process booking data:
javascript
Copy code
exports.handler = async (event) => {
    const bookingData = JSON.parse(event.body);

    // Process the booking data (e.g., save to a database, send email, etc.)

    return {
        statusCode: 200,
        headers: {
            "Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "*",
            "Access-Control-Allow-Methods": "POST,GET,OPTIONS"
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({ message: "Booking successful!", data: bookingData }),
    };
};
Click Deploy to save your changes.
Configure Permissions for Lambda:

In the Execution role section, Lambda should have automatically created an execution role with the necessary permissions.
If you need to add additional permissions (e.g., to access other AWS services like DynamoDB), go to IAM > Roles and attach additional policies.
Step 3: Set Up API Gateway to Expose the Lambda Function
Go to the API Gateway Console:

Search for API Gateway in the AWS Console and click API Gateway.
Create a New REST API:

Click Create API.
Choose REST API and click Build.
Name your API (e.g., WasteNotBookingAPI).
Keep Endpoint Type as Regional and click Create API.
Create a New Resource:

In the left-hand menu, click Resources.
Click Actions > Create Resource.
Name it (e.g., /submit_booking) and click Create Resource.
Create a POST Method:

Select the /submit_booking resource.
Click Actions > Create Method.
Choose POST and click the checkmark.
In the Integration type, select Lambda Function.
Choose the Lambda Region and enter your Lambda function's name (e.g., SubmitBookingFunction).
Click Save and confirm.
(Workaround for CORS Issue):

Since CORS headers did not automatically show up in the API Gateway's POST method, we manually added them in the Lambda function response instead.
Make sure the Lambda function has this section in the response headers:
javascript
Copy code
headers: {
    "Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "*",
    "Access-Control-Allow-Methods": "POST,GET,OPTIONS"
}
Deploy the API:

Click Actions > Deploy API.
Create a new stage (e.g., dev).
Click Deploy.
Get the API Gateway Invoke URL:

After deployment, copy the Invoke URL for your stage (it will look like https://your-api-id.execute-api.region.amazonaws.com/dev).
This will be the URL used by your frontend to make API calls.
Step 4: Connect the Frontend to the API Gateway
Update Your Frontend:

In your booking.html file, update the fetch URL in the JavaScript to the API Gateway Invoke URL:
javascript
Copy code
document.getElementById('bookingForm').addEventListener('submit', async function (e) {
    e.preventDefault();

    const name = document.getElementById('name').value;
    const location = document.getElementById('location').value;
    const date = document.getElementById('date').value;

    try {
        const response = await fetch('https://your-api-id.execute-api.region.amazonaws.com/dev/submit_booking', {
            method: 'POST',
            headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
            body: JSON.stringify({ name: name, location: location, date: date }),
        });

        const result = await response.json();
        alert(result.message);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error:', error);
        alert('Booking failed. Please try again.');
    }
});
Upload the Updated Frontend Files to S3:

Go to the S3 Console and navigate to your websiteâ€™s S3 bucket.
Upload the updated booking.html file and replace the existing version.
Step 5: Enable CloudWatch Logs for Debugging
Set Up CloudWatch Logs for API Gateway:

In API Gateway, go to Stages > dev.
Scroll down to Logs/Tracing.
Enable CloudWatch Logs and set the Log level to INFO.
Click Save.
Set Up CloudWatch Logs for Lambda:

Lambda logs to CloudWatch by default.
Go to CloudWatch > Logs and view logs for your Lambda function to troubleshoot any issues.
Step 6: Test the Application
Access Your Website:

Go to your S3 static website URL (found in the Properties tab of your S3 bucket).
Submit a Booking:

Test the booking form by submitting a name, location, and date.
Check CloudWatch Logs:

If there are any errors, check the CloudWatch logs for both API Gateway and Lambda to see detailed logs of the requests and responses.
Step 7: Clean Up AWS Resources (Optional)
If you want to remove all the resources after testing:

Delete the API Gateway:

Go to API Gateway, select the API, and click Actions > Delete API.
Delete the Lambda Function:

Go to Lambda, select the function, and click Actions > Delete.
Delete the S3 Bucket:

In S3, select the bucket, and click Delete.
Delete CloudWatch Log Groups:

Go to CloudWatch, find the log groups, and delete the ones related to your API and Lambda.

Absolutely! Here's the updated step-by-step guide to building your website on AWS from scratch, with the CORS issue fix integrated directly into the Lambda step to avoid confusion. This guide incorporates all the troubleshooting and workarounds we encountered.

Step-by-Step Guide to Building a Website on AWS (with CORS Fix)
Step 1: Set Up the S3 Bucket to Host Your Static Website
Go to the AWS S3 Console:

Open the AWS Management Console and search for S3.
Click on S3.
Create an S3 Bucket:

Click Create bucket.
Give your bucket a globally unique name (e.g., wastenot-website1).
Choose your AWS region.
Leave all other settings as default and click Create bucket.

Go to your newly created bucket, and click on the Properties tab.
Scroll down to the Static website hosting section.
Click Edit and Enable static website hosting.
Set the Index document to index.html.
You can leave the Error document blank.
Click Save changes.
Upload Your Website Files:

In the Objects tab, click Upload.
Upload your index.html, booking.html, styles.css, or other frontend files.
Once uploaded, ensure they have public read access.
Make the S3 Bucket Public:

Go to the Permissions tab of the bucket.
Scroll down to the Bucket Policy section and add this policy:
json
Copy code
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::wastenot-website1/*"
        }
    ]
}
Replace wastenot-website1 with your actual bucket name.
This allows public access to your website files.
Get the S3 Static Website URL:

In the Properties tab, scroll to Static website hosting and copy the Endpoint URL.
This will be your website's public URL.
Step 2: Create the Lambda Function for Backend Logic (with CORS Fix)
Go to the AWS Lambda Console:

Search for Lambda in the AWS Console and click Lambda.
Create a New Lambda Function:

Click Create function.
Choose Author from scratch.
Name the function (e.g., SubmitBookingFunction).
Choose the Runtime (e.g., Node.js 18.x).
Click Create function.
Write the Lambda Function Code (Include the CORS Headers in the Response):

Scroll down to the Code section of the Lambda function.
Replace the default code with this Node.js example to process booking data and ensure the CORS headers are included in the response:
javascript
Copy code
exports.handler = async (event) => {
    const bookingData = JSON.parse(event.body);

    // Process the booking data (e.g., save to a database, send email, etc.)

    return {
        statusCode: 200,
        headers: {
            "Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "*",  // CORS Fix: Allow all origins
            "Access-Control-Allow-Methods": "POST,GET,OPTIONS",  // CORS Fix: Allow these methods
            "Access-Control-Allow-Headers": "Content-Type"  // CORS Fix: Allow specific headers
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({ message: "Booking successful!", data: bookingData }),
    };
};
Click Deploy to save your changes.
Configure Permissions for Lambda:

In the Execution role section, Lambda should have automatically created an execution role with the necessary permissions.
If you need to add additional permissions (e.g., to access other AWS services like DynamoDB), go to IAM > Roles and attach additional policies.
Step 3: Set Up API Gateway to Expose the Lambda Function
Go to the API Gateway Console:

Search for API Gateway in the AWS Console and click API Gateway.
Create a New REST API:

Click Create API.
Choose REST API and click Build.
Name your API (e.g., WasteNotBookingAPI).
Keep Endpoint Type as Regional and click Create API.
Create a New Resource:

In the left-hand menu, click Resources.
Click Actions > Create Resource.
Name it (e.g., /submit_booking) and click Create Resource.
Create a POST Method:

Select the /submit_booking resource.
Click Actions > Create Method.
Choose POST and click the checkmark.
In the Integration type, select Lambda Function.
Choose the Lambda Region and enter your Lambda function's name (e.g., SubmitBookingFunction).
Click Save and confirm.
(Workaround for CORS Issue):

Since CORS headers did not automatically show up in the API Gateway's POST method response, we manually added them in the Lambda function response itself (already done in Step 2).
No further CORS setup is needed in API Gateway.
Deploy the API:

Click Actions > Deploy API.
Create a new stage (e.g., dev).
Click Deploy.
Get the API Gateway Invoke URL:

After deployment, copy the Invoke URL for your stage (it will look like https://your-api-id.execute-api.region.amazonaws.com/dev).
This will be the URL used by your frontend to make API calls.
Step 4: Connect the Frontend to the API Gateway
Update Your Frontend:

In your booking.html file, update the fetch URL in the JavaScript to the API Gateway Invoke URL:
javascript
Copy code
document.getElementById('bookingForm').addEventListener('submit', async function (e) {
    e.preventDefault();

    const name = document.getElementById('name').value;
    const location = document.getElementById('location').value;
    const date = document.getElementById('date').value;

    try {
        const response = await fetch('https://your-api-id.execute-api.region.amazonaws.com/dev/submit_booking', {
            method: 'POST',
            headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
            body: JSON.stringify({ name: name, location: location, date: date }),
        });

        const result = await response.json();
        alert(result.message);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error:', error);
        alert('Booking failed. Please try again.');
    }
});
Upload the Updated Frontend Files to S3:

Go to the S3 Console and navigate to your websiteâ€™s S3 bucket.
Upload the updated booking.html file and replace the existing version.
Step 5: Enable CloudWatch Logs for Debugging
Set Up CloudWatch Logs for API Gateway:

In API Gateway, go to Stages > dev.
Scroll down to Logs/Tracing.
Enable CloudWatch Logs and set the Log level to INFO.
Click Save.
Set Up CloudWatch Logs for Lambda:

Lambda logs to CloudWatch by default.
Go to CloudWatch > Logs and view logs for your Lambda function to troubleshoot any issues.
Step 6: Test the Application
Access Your Website:

Go to your S3 static website URL (found in the Properties tab of your S3 bucket).
Submit a Booking:

Test the booking form by submitting a name, location, and date.
Check CloudWatch Logs:

If there are any errors, check the CloudWatch logs for both API Gateway and Lambda to see detailed logs of the requests and responses.
Step 7: Clean Up AWS Resources (Optional)
If you want to remove all the resources after testing:

Delete the API Gateway:

Go to API Gateway, select the API, and click Actions > Delete API.
Delete the Lambda Function:

Go to Lambda, select the function, and click Actions > Delete.
Delete the S3 Bucket:

In S3, select the bucket, and click Delete.
