### **WasteNot: Problem and Opportunity Analysis (UK-based)** 🇬🇧

#### **1. What is the problem or opportunity?**
The problem is food waste and hunger coexisting in communities across the UK. Retailers, particularly those selling perishable items like supermarkets 🏪, often throw away food nearing its expiration date despite it still being safe and edible 🥑🍞. At the same time, millions of people across the UK struggle with food insecurity. 

**Opportunity**: WasteNot provides a solution by offering a platform that connects retailers with surplus perishable food to individuals and charities in need. This not only reduces waste ♻️ but also helps feed local communities 🍽️. 

#### **2. What measure shows that the problem is real?**
- **Food Waste in the UK**: According to WRAP (Waste and Resources Action Programme), the UK throws away around **9.5 million tonnes of food annually**, of which 70% is still edible 🍅🥬. 
- **Food Insecurity in the UK**: More than 4 million people in the UK, including 1.7 million children, face food insecurity, as per the Food Foundation.

These figures clearly show that food waste and hunger are significant problems that need urgent attention. WasteNot can play a vital role in addressing these issues locally.

#### **3. What would you measure to prove that you resolved the problem, and how would you measure it?**
To demonstrate WasteNot's impact, we would track the following:
- **Reduction in Food Waste**: The total weight (in tonnes) of food rescued from going to landfill and redistributed.
- **Number of Meals Provided**: Estimate the number of meals 🍽️ based on the weight and type of food donated through the platform.
- **Community Engagement**: The number of stores, charities, and individuals actively using the platform.
- **Cost Savings for Retailers**: Track how much participating stores save on waste disposal and other operational costs through food donations.

These metrics can be tracked using built-in analytics within the app 📊, which can generate detailed reports for both stores and WasteNot administrators.

#### **4. What is the cause of the problem?**
- **Retail Habits**: UK supermarkets and stores are often required to dispose of food that is close to its "best before" or "use by" date due to health regulations, even if it's still edible.
- **Limited Redistribution Channels**: Many stores lack a streamlined process for donating surplus food to local charities or food banks.
- **Food Insecurity**: Low-income households and individuals across the UK frequently face challenges in accessing nutritious food, even though local stores are throwing away surplus produce.

#### **5. How will the business measure that the solution meets the goals of the business?**
WasteNot will measure its success by monitoring:
- **Waste Reduction**: The total amount of food (in tonnes) diverted from landfill through donations.
- **Community Engagement**: The number of active users, including UK-based retailers, charities, and individuals benefiting from the platform.
- **Environmental Impact**: Reduced carbon footprint 🌍 due to decreased food waste and reduced greenhouse gas emissions from food decomposition in landfills. WasteNot will quantify this in terms of CO₂ emissions saved.
- **Feedback from Users**: Regular feedback surveys 📋 from both retailers and community members to ensure ease of use and satisfaction.
- **Financial Impact**: Track cost reductions for UK retailers by reducing food waste disposal fees and any potential revenue streams, such as premium memberships or sponsorships.

#### **6. Specify a product design to satisfy the requirements.**
The **WasteNot app** will be designed with the following key features:
- **User-friendly Interface for Retailers** 🛒: UK-based stores can quickly upload available surplus food, set pickup windows 🕒, and track donations easily through a clean dashboard.
- **Real-time Availability for Users** 📲: Individuals and charities can browse available food items in real-time, filter by categories (e.g., fruits, vegetables, bread 🍞🍓), and book items for collection.
- **Local Search** 🔍: The app will provide location-based services, ensuring users find food donations closest to them, reducing travel and logistics costs.
- **Data Analytics and Reporting** 📊: Real-time tracking of food donations, waste saved, meals served, and environmental impact (e.g., CO₂ reductions) will be available for stores and app administrators.
- **Gamification Features** 🎮: Stores can earn badges or incentives based on how much food they donate, encouraging more businesses to participate and improve their sustainability efforts.

This design ensures that **WasteNot** aligns with the goals of reducing food waste, helping those in need, and promoting sustainability throughout the UK.
